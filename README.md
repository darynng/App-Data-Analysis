Profitable App Profile Analysis

This project aims to identify profitable app profiles — apps that are more likely to attract users — to help developers make informed, data-driven decisions about the kinds of apps they should build.

We analyze datasets from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store to ensure the study is relevant across the two most dominant app marketplaces.

Key Insights:
- Free apps obviously are the best option.
- Navigation and Communication categories seem to be popular but are actually skewed up by only a few giants.
- Entertainment and Games categoies are popular but the market is pretty saturated.
- Book and Reference category appears to be the winner with small account of the market but significant installs and number of ratings.
